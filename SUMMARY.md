# LangGraphRB - Summary of Implementation

## Overview

Successfully created a Ruby library inspired by LangGraph (Python) that provides a framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications using directed graphs. The library models complex workflows as graphs where nodes are executable functions and edges define flow control.

## Core Components Implemented

### 1. State Management (`lib/langgraph_rb/state.rb`)
- **State Class**: Extends Hash with reducer support
- **Reducers**: Functions that define how state updates are merged
- **Built-in Reducers**: 
  - `add_messages` - Appends to arrays
  - `append_string` - Concatenates strings  
  - `merge_hash` - Deep merges hashes

### 2. Node System (`lib/langgraph_rb/node.rb`)
- **Base Node**: Callable functions that process state
- **LLMNode**: Specialized node for LLM integrations
- **ToolNode**: Specialized node for tool/function calls
- **Flexible Arity**: Supports 0, 1, or 2 parameter node functions

### 3. Edge Routing (`lib/langgraph_rb/edge.rb`)
- **Simple Edges**: Direct node-to-node connections
- **Conditional Edges**: Router-function based routing with path mapping
- **Fan-out Edges**: Parallel execution to multiple destinations
- **Router Helper**: Builder pattern for complex conditional logic

### 4. Execution Control (`lib/langgraph_rb/command.rb`)
- **Command**: Combines state update + routing decision
- **Send**: Creates parallel execution branches (map-reduce)
- **MultiSend**: Multiple parallel branches
- **Interrupt**: Human-in-the-loop pause points
- **Helper Methods**: Convenient command creation

### 5. Graph Definition (`lib/langgraph_rb/graph.rb`)
- **DSL**: Clean syntax for defining workflows
- **Validation**: Compile-time graph validation
- **Mermaid Generation**: Automatic diagram creation
- **Entry/Exit Points**: START and FINISH node management

### 6. Execution Engine (`lib/langgraph_rb/runner.rb`)
- **Parallel Execution**: Thread-based super-step processing
- **State Checkpointing**: Automatic state persistence
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time progress monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Safe node execution with error propagation
- **Resume Capability**: Restart from any checkpoint

### 7. Persistence Layer (`lib/langgraph_rb/stores/memory.rb`)
- **In-Memory Store**: For testing and development
- **File Store**: YAML-based persistence
- **JSON Store**: JSON-based persistence
- **Extensible**: Abstract base for custom stores

## Comparison with LangGraph (Python)

| Feature | LangGraphRB | LangGraph (Python) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Graph Definition | ✅ Ruby DSL | ✅ Python Builder |
| Parallel Execution | ✅ Threads | ✅ AsyncIO |
| State Management | ✅ Reducers | ✅ Reducers |
| Checkpointing | ✅ Multiple stores | ✅ Multiple stores |
| Human-in-the-loop | ✅ Interrupts | ✅ Interrupts |
| Map-Reduce | ✅ Send commands | ✅ Send API |
| Streaming | ✅ Blocks | ✅ AsyncIO |
| Visualization | ✅ Mermaid | ✅ Mermaid |

## Usage Patterns

### Simple Linear Workflow
```ruby
graph = LangGraphRB::Graph.new do
  node :process { |state| { result: process(state[:input]) } }
  node :validate { |state| { valid: validate(state[:result]) } }
  
  set_entry_point :process
  edge :process, :validate
  set_finish_point :validate
end
```

### Conditional Routing
```ruby
conditional_edge :router, ->(state) { 
  state[:priority] == 'high' ? :urgent_handler : :normal_handler 
}
```

### Parallel Processing
```ruby
node :fan_out do |state|
  sends = state[:items].map do |item|
    LangGraphRB::Send.new(to: :process_item, payload: { item: item })
  end
  LangGraphRB::MultiSend.new(sends)
end
```

## Ready for Production Use

The library provides:
- **Robust error handling** with try/catch in node execution
- **Persistent checkpointing** for durable workflows  
- **Thread-safe operations** for concurrent execution
- **Memory management** with configurable stores
- **Comprehensive validation** at compile time
- **Clean abstractions** for extensibility

## Next Steps for Enhancement
